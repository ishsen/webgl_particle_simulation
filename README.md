# WebGL Particle Simulation

The progression of an infectious disease modeled by a particle simulation. Two particles colliding carries a chance of spread based on heuristics and chance of susceptibility and infectivity of the two particles. Javscript was used for creating the logic in the simulated world and WebGL was used for the visualization.

### TODO
- [x] Tranferred particle movement to WebGL
- [x] Created ability to pause and play simulation
- [ ] Add ability to place obstacles and quarantine zones
- [ ] Improve logic for infection states and more informed heuristics
